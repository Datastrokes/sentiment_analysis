Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick.

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n","\n","\n","A wonderful little production.  The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.\n","\n","\n","I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love. This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"Devil Wears Prada\" and more interesting than \"Superman\" a great comedy to go see with friends.\n","\n","\n","Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time. 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\n","\n","\n","Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter.  We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\n","\n","\n","Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like \"dressed-up midgets\" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be \"up\" for this movie.\n","\n","\n","I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,If this is so then I must go so lets do it.\n","\n","\n","This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today. It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn't still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still on the air.\n","\n","\n","Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film.  The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.\n","\n","\n","If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it. Great Camp!!!\n","\n","\n","Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. For something similar but better try \"Brother from another planet\"\n","\n","\n","I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror. But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.\n","\n","\n","So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished.  There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.\n","\n","\n","The cast played Shakespeare. I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it.\n","\n","\n","This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. One of the actors is george clooney and I'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (The man of constant sorrow). I recommand this movie to everybody. Greetings Bart\n","\n","\n","Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....\n","\n","\n","Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.\n","\n","\n","This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible.  Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.\n","\n","\n","I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.\n","\n","\n","An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2 check for urls\n","def check_urls(text):\n","  pattern=re.compile('https?://\\S+|www\\.S+')\n","  return pattern.search(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"QOi6tH7nLpO0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901204145,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":587,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(df['review'].apply(check_urls).value_counts())"],"metadata":{"id":"i8FSa3avMk29","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901206862,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1066,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}},"outputId":"aac41e4a-95f3-4506-b795-97654b045406"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["94"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["As we can see we that there are urls in the dataset so we need to handel them\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eOx287NES2XD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def re_urls(text):\n","  pattern=re.compile(\"https?://\\S+|www.\\S+\")\n","  return pattern.sub(\"\",text)"],"metadata":{"id":"mgS4zT4aNf5n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901209600,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":872,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['review']=df['review'].apply(re_urls)"],"metadata":{"id":"zEkq0VL-OfId","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901213330,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":501,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 3.Let's handel the contraction"],"metadata":{"id":"npXuo3fFTxMc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901215550,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":555,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import sys      #This pice of code is used to import liberary which if stored in google drive\n","                #this is code is not compulsory when you are using local machine\n","sys.path.append(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/env/lib/python3.10/site-packages\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Am5C-84pT4d-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901218038,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":501,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import contractions"],"metadata":{"id":"BCdgVr_iT6bF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901245076,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6476,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['review']=df['review'].apply(contractions.fix)"],"metadata":{"id":"--WwdR93YGot","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901252432,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3505,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head(50)"],"metadata":{"id":"RLGblJGGYThs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733901252433,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kushwaha","userId":"18404111917295064973"}},"outputId":"d586026f-3870-4dee-b2cb-d714064d0be7"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               review sentiment\n","0   One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...  positive\n","1   A wonderful little production.

Released five years before the Broadway opening of \\\"Dreamgirls\\\" and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up-and-coming girl group, and that is where the resemblance basically ends. Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product (\\\"Batman Forever\\\", \\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\\"), this movie seems grittier on the surface. True to form, however, Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clich\\u00e9s and eye-rolling one-liners. With little affinity for staging musical numbers, Sam O'Steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget TV-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure. The solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. Lonette McKee's valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns, including a sad Billie Holliday-like turn at the mike. Before they hit it big on primetime TV, Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood portray Stix and Levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility. The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-\\\"Fame\\\" Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role (though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene). The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice-over by DJ Casey Kasem and a bonus CD of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by Aretha Franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack. It is not a terrible movie, just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as \\\"Dreamgirls\\\".\",\n          \"Brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, and not just the ones that are measured by popularity. It shows a stark portrayal of Larkins life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - which is exactly how he would have wanted it, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. It dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality, and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers. for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death this is a must.\",\n          \"I have watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. This movie is also known as \\\"Castle Of Terror\\\", \\\"Coffin Of Terror\\\", and \\\"Dance Macabre\\\". Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. The camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, is not bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD uncut version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy. John R.

reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you will be hooked They are right as this is exactly what happened with me I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceOZ does not mess around The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal I could not say I was ready for it but as I watched more I developed a taste for Oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence Not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience Watching Oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthat is if you can get in touch with your darker side\n","\n","\n","A wonderful little production  The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with Halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done\n","\n","\n","I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2 Risk Addiction I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends\n","\n","\n","Basically there is a family where a little boy Jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs As for the shots with Jake just ignore them\n","\n","\n","Petter Matteis Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch Mr Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  We wish Mr Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work\n","\n","\n","Probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble because but it is not preachy or boring It just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years Paul Lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight The kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch And the mothers slow awakening to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling If I had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie\n","\n","\n","I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in meI grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my heros every weekYou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntWe need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventureOh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many moviesSo any ole way I believe I have got what I want to sayWould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntIf my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitIf this is so then I must go so let us do it\n","\n","\n","This show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that By 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today It is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen The writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably would not still be on the air I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success As it is now the show is just awful I cannot believe it is still on the air\n","\n","\n","Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film Bad mistake I have seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film  The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is Harvey Keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort One for Keitel obsessives only\n","\n","\n","If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie If you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it Great Camp\n","\n","\n","Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines For something similar but better try Brother from another planet\n","\n","\n","I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air The horror The horror But about a year or so later I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star Janet Leigh was bumped off early in the film I sat up and took notice at that point Since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula There are no rules\n","\n","\n","So i am not a big fan of Bolls work but then again not many are I enjoyed his movie Postal maybe i am the only one Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished  There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes Until the whole cromedalbino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you want to take a wiff go ahead BY THE WAY Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen\n","\n","\n","The cast played Shakespeare I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it\n","\n","\n","This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous One of the actors is george clooney and I am not a fan but this roll is not bad Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack The man of constant sorrow I recommand this movie to everybody Greetings Bart\n","\n","\n","Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I have ever seen Sort of like a high school film project What was Rosanna Arquette thinking And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town Pretty hard to get involved with this one No lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsenseWhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters And what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles Give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa\n","\n","\n","Some films just simply should not be remade This is one of them In and of itself it is not a bad film But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more\n","\n","\n","This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies Horrible  Just awful A real disappointment to say the least Save your money\n","\n","\n","I remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my Dad took me my brother  sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me knowThe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it\n","\n","\n","An awful film It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe They have taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine But it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script I suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version It is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity\n","\n","\n","After the success of Die Hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of Die Hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept That is what they did with Cliffhanger Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Stallones career So forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy And if you are looking for Qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter\n","\n","\n","I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety Even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch\n","\n","\n","What an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you will not regret it it is too much fun Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him I still liked it The music by ARRehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it\n","\n","\n","First of all let us get a few things straight here a I AM an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool b I DO like several BMovies because they are hilarious c I like the Godzilla movies a lot According to my grading scale 310 means Pretty much both boring  bad As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15\n","\n","\n","This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film It is great to see JBeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes MParker is a much better actress than the part allowed for The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch There is no real emotional depth to the story A movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me Nor does the development of the cop It feels like one of many straighttovideo movies I saw back in the 90s  And not even a good one in those standards \n","\n","\n","The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenters complex life Though it fails in giving accurate facts and details It has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album Unfortunately they were not though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries\n","\n","\n","The Cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations This is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent This is the best movie of the year to date  out of 4\n","\n","\n","This film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire Hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on It failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS which similarly trivializes a genuine because for concern\n","\n","\n","This movie was so frustrating Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time I at least thought I would be able to stand it But I was wrong First the weird looping It was like watching Americas Funniest Home Videos The damn parents I hated them so much The stereotypical Latino family I need to speak with the person responsible for this We need to have a talk That little girl who was always hanging on someone I just hated her and had to mention it Now the final scene transcends I must say It is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own What crappy dancing Horrible and beautiful at once\n","\n","\n","War movie is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen The Civil Warera Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film Make no mistake Cold Mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether\n","\n","\n","Taut and organically gripping Edward Dmytryks Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle But while the change from homophobia to antiSemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly The victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating Ryans murderous rage\n","\n","\n","Ardh Satya is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success Even today Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India Finally the films belongs to the One man show Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly\n","\n","\n","My first exposure to the Templarios  not a good one I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video which has brought us other cult classics such as Spider Baby The print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull There is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling Adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket\n","\n","\n","One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman Titta Di Girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy When we are introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italianspeaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous He says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth Having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamos troubles  The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia played by Olivia Magnani granddaughter of the legendary Anna and the memory of Tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again Though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations Le Conseguenze dellAmore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postinolike fare more La Vita è Bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dellAmore LImbalsamatore and others Your loss world\n","\n","\n","I watched this film not really expecting much I got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect and you know what I was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious I had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot I thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and I have not even mentioned the killer I am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining Anyway as far as I am concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent I have certainly seen a lot worse but I have also seen a lot better Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry\n","\n","\n","I bought this film at Blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit Ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge I was 100 wrong Just say no to this movie though 210\n","\n","\n","The plot is about the death of little children Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter In the end the serial killer get caught That is it But before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors It is unbelievable how bad these actors are including Hopper I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time Just do not watch the movie I have warned you\n","\n","\n","Ever watched a movie that lost the plot Well this did not even really have one to begin with It really IS only a movie as they say\n","\n","\n","Okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again Week in week out David Morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle  but what is wrong with that David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by David Koepp  a great writer  is heaven Due to the lack of love for this show by many I cannot see it going to a season series  but you never know The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me  let us hope something good can make it past a first series\n","\n","\n","After sitting through this pile of dung my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie It was that listless and formulaic But the YOUS propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it is the work of humans Call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq etc The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene The reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow And there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny with Dr WhateverHerNameWas being chided by all involved for never shutting up She is clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a Dr title on her character to give her some gravity At one point Cages character says Do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child Truly grotesque The only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it Creepy\n","\n","\n","It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it The production was good however the script and acting were Bmovie quality The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors The good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others  If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still would not recommend this movie\n","\n","\n","This movie is based on the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites a topic that comes from Hans personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China That background and the beautiful Hong Kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time The cinematography really brings out fiftys Hong Kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments The ending is a real tearjerker Some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories this is a shining example\n","\n","\n","Of all the films I have seen this one The Rage has got to be one of the worst yet The direction LOGIC continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy Gary Busey is know for his B movies but this is a sure W movie Wwaste Take for example about two dozen FBI  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer Inside the jeep is MA and is confused as to why all the cops are about Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues MA being killed straight off The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough Truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle\n","\n","\n","I had heard good things about States of Grace and came in with an open mind I thought that Gods Army was okay and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker The film began with some shaky acting and I thought well maybe it will get better Unfortunately it never did The picture starts out by introducing two elders  Mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them Instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable The conclusion which I am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy Next time Dutcher try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with\n","\n","\n","This movie struck home for me Being 29 I remember the 80s and my father working in a factory I figured if I worked hard too if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own I have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS it is made for TV and I just saw it an hour ago Ic ant find it anywhere I would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished I think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas\n","\n","\n","As a disclaimer I have seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and I only just saw the musical this week This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when I watched the musical    The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\n","\n","\n","Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldies charm just does not save this movie Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film\n","\n","\n","How this film could be classified as Drama I have no idea If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen I would be trying to erase this from my CV It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah Lot Abrahams nephew Lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born Canaanites wandered the earthreally What were the scriptwriters thinking Was it just ignorance I remember something about Noah and animals and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from Christians Jews and Muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one\n","\n","\n","Preston Sturgis THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kaels THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz  Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis screenplay here As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site Kael overstated her case The film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly Yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans Sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail So on the whole it is a first rate film No CITIZEN KANE perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America\n","\n","\n","Average and surprisingly tame Fulci giallo which means it is still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist

reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you will be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthat is if you can get in touch with your darker side\n","\n","\n","a wonderful little production  the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done\n","\n","\n","i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends\n","\n","\n","basically there is a family where a little boy jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them\n","\n","\n","petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work\n","\n","\n","probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble because but it is not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie\n","\n","\n","i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventureoh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many moviesso any ole way i believe i have got what i want to saywould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so let us do it\n","\n","\n","this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably would not still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cannot believe it is still on the air\n","\n","\n","encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i have seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film  the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only\n","\n","\n","if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp\n","\n","\n","phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines for something similar but better try brother from another planet\n","\n","\n","i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules\n","\n","\n","so i am not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe i am the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished  there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you want to take a wiff go ahead by the way carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen\n","\n","\n","the cast played shakespeare i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it\n","\n","\n","this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i am not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart\n","\n","\n","kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i have ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa\n","\n","\n","some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more\n","\n","\n","this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible  just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money\n","\n","\n","i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my dad took me my brother  sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it\n","\n","\n","an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity\n","\n","\n","after the success of die hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you are looking for qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter\n","\n","\n","i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch\n","\n","\n","what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you will not regret it it is too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it\n","\n","\n","first of all let us get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because they are hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot according to my grading scale 310 means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15\n","\n","\n","this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it is great to see jbeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the 90s  and not even a good one in those standards \n","\n","\n","the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they were not though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries\n","\n","\n","the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date  out of 4\n","\n","\n","this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine because for concern\n","\n","\n","this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once\n","\n","\n","war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether\n","\n","\n","taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\n","\n","\n","ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly\n","\n","\n","my first exposure to the templarios  not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket\n","\n","\n","one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we are introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles  the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita è bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world\n","\n","\n","i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry\n","\n","\n","i bought this film at blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong just say no to this movie though 210\n","\n","\n","the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that is it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just do not watch the movie i have warned you\n","\n","\n","ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this did not even really have one to begin with it really is only a movie as they say\n","\n","\n","okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle  but what is wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david koepp  a great writer  is heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i cannot see it going to a season series  but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me  let us hope something good can make it past a first series\n","\n","\n","after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the yous propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it is the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up she is clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy\n","\n","\n","it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others  if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still would not recommend this movie\n","\n","\n","this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example\n","\n","\n","of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste take for example about two dozen fbi  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle\n","\n","\n","i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders  mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable the conclusion which i am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with\n","\n","\n","this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the 80s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it is made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere i would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas\n","\n","\n","as a disclaimer i have seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical    the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\n","\n","\n","protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just does not save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film\n","\n","\n","how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one\n","\n","\n","preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz  orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case the film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america\n","\n","\n","average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it is still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist

reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you will be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthat is if you can get in touch with your darker side\n","\n","a wonderful little production  the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done\n","\n","i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends\n","\n","basically there is a family where a little boy jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them\n","\n","petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work\n","\n","probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble because but it is not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie\n","\n","i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventureoh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many moviesso any ole way i believe i have got what i want to saywould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so let us do it\n","\n","this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably would not still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cannot believe it is still on the air\n","\n","encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i have seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film  the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only\n","\n","if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp\n","\n","phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines for something similar but better try brother from another planet\n","\n","i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules\n","\n","so i am not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe i am the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished  there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you want to take a wiff go ahead by the way carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen\n","\n","the cast played shakespeare i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it\n","\n","this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i am not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart\n","\n","kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i have ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa\n","\n","some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more\n","\n","this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible  just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money\n","\n","i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my dad took me my brother  sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it\n","\n","an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity\n","\n","after the success of die hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you are looking for qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter\n","\n","i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch\n","\n","what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you will not regret it it is too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it\n","\n","first of all let us get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because they are hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot according to my grading scale 310 means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15\n","\n","this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it is great to see jbeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the 90s  and not even a good one in those standards \n","\n","the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they were not though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries\n","\n","the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date  out of 4\n","\n","this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine because for concern\n","\n","this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once\n","\n","war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether\n","\n","taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\n","\n","ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly\n","\n","my first exposure to the templarios  not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket\n","\n","one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we are introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles  the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita è bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world\n","\n","i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry\n","\n","i bought this film at blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong just say no to this movie though 210\n","\n","the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that is it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just do not watch the movie i have warned you\n","\n","ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this did not even really have one to begin with it really is only a movie as they say\n","\n","okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle  but what is wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david koepp  a great writer  is heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i cannot see it going to a season series  but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me  let us hope something good can make it past a first series\n","\n","after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the yous propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it is the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up she is clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy\n","\n","it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others  if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still would not recommend this movie\n","\n","this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example\n","\n","of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste take for example about two dozen fbi  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle\n","\n","i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders  mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable the conclusion which i am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with\n","\n","this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the 80s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it is made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere i would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas\n","\n","as a disclaimer i have seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical    the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\n","\n","protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just does not save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film\n","\n","how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one\n","\n","preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz  orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case the film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america\n","\n","average and

reviewers has mentioned that after watching just  oz episode you will be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthat is if you can get in touch with your darker side\n","\n","a wonderful little production  the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done\n","\n","i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point  risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends\n","\n","basically there is a family where a little boy jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time  out of  just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them\n","\n","petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work\n","\n","probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble because but it is not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some  or more times in the last  years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie\n","\n","i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventureoh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many moviesso any ole way i believe i have got what i want to saywould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be  lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so let us do it\n","\n","this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the s when it first aired the first  or  years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by  the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably would not still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give  stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cannot believe it is still on the air\n","\n","encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i have seen  films and this is truly one of the worst of them  it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film  the only thing that prevents me giving this a score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only\n","\n","if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp\n","\n","phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines for something similar but better try brother from another planet\n","\n","i saw this movie when i was about  when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules\n","\n","so i am not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe i am the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished  there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you want to take a wiff go ahead by the way carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen\n","\n","the cast played shakespeare i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it\n","\n","this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i am not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart\n","\n","kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i have ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa\n","\n","some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the  film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more\n","\n","this movie made it into one of my top  most awful movies horrible  just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money\n","\n","i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in  my dad took me my brother  sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is  miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it\n","\n","an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity\n","\n","after the success of die hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you are looking for qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter\n","\n","i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch\n","\n","what an absolutely stunning movie if you have  hrs to kill watch it you will not regret it it is too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it\n","\n","first of all let us get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because they are hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot according to my grading scale  means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to \n","\n","this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it is great to see jbeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the s  and not even a good one in those standards \n","\n","the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they were not though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries\n","\n","the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date  out of \n","\n","this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine because for concern\n","\n","this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once\n","\n","war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether\n","\n","taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\n","\n","ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly\n","\n","my first exposure to the templarios  not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket\n","\n","one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we are introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that  dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles  the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in  years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita è bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world\n","\n","i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of  films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry\n","\n","i bought this film at blockbuster for  because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was  wrong just say no to this movie though \n","\n","the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that is it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just do not watch the movie i have warned you\n","\n","ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this did not even really have one to begin with it really is only a movie as they say\n","\n","okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle  but what is wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david koepp  a great writer  is heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i cannot see it going to a season series  but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me  let us hope something good can make it past a first series\n","\n","after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the yous propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it is the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up she is clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy\n","\n","it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others  if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still would not recommend this movie\n","\n","this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example\n","\n","of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste take for example about two dozen fbi  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held  bullets has there been such a miracle\n","\n","i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders  mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable the conclusion which i am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with\n","\n","this movie struck home for me being  i remember the s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it is made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere i would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas\n","\n","as a disclaimer i have seen the movie  times in the last  years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical    the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\n","\n","protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just does not save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film\n","\n","how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one\n","\n","preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz  orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case the film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america\n","\n","average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it is still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance  out of  limping killers\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def re_spaces(text):\n","

reviewers has mentioned that after watching just  oz episode you will be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthat is if you can get in touch with your darker side\n","\n","a wonderful little production  the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done\n","\n","i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point  risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends\n","\n","basically there is a family where a little boy jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time  out of  just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them\n","\n","petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work\n","\n","probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble because but it is not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some  or more times in the last  years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie\n","\n","i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of

some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be  lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so let us do it\n","\n","this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the s when it first aired the first  or  years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by  the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably would not still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give  stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cannot believe it is still on the air\n","\n","encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i have seen  films and this is truly one of the worst of them  it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film  the only thing that prevents me giving this a score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only\n","\n","if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp\n","\n","phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines for something similar but better try brother from another planet\n","\n","i saw this movie when i was about  when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules\n","\n","so i am not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe i am the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished  there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you want to take a wiff go ahead by the way carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen\n","\n","the cast played shakespeare i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it\n","\n","this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i am not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart\n","\n","kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i have ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa\n","\n","some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the  film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more\n","\n","this movie made it into one of my top  most awful movies horrible  just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money\n","\n","i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in  my dad took me my brother  sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is  miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it\n","\n","an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity\n","\n","after the success of die hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you are looking for qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter\n","\n","i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch\n","\n","what an absolutely stunning movie if you have  hrs to kill watch it you will not regret it it is too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it\n","\n","first of all let us get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because they are hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot according to my grading scale  means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to \n","\n","this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it is great to see jbeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the s  and not even a good one in those standards \n","\n","the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they were not though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries\n","\n","the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date  out of \n","\n","this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine because for concern\n","\n","this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once\n","\n","war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether\n","\n","taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\n","\n","ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly\n","\n","my first exposure to the templarios  not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket\n","\n","one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we are introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that  dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles  the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in  years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the s the world is waiting for italy to

character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy\n","\n","it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others  if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still would not recommend this movie\n","\n","this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example\n","\n","of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste take for example about two dozen fbi  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held  bullets has there been such a miracle\n","\n","i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders  mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable the conclusion which i am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with\n","\n","this movie struck home for me being  i remember the s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it is made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere i would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas\n","\n","as a disclaimer i have seen the movie  times in the last  years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical    the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\n","\n","protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just does not save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film\n","\n","how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one\n","\n","preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz  orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case the film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america\n","\n","average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it is still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance  out of  limping killers\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let us do
